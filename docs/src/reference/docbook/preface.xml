		Spring Data GemFire focuses on integrating the Spring Framework's powerful, non-invasive programming model
		and concepts with Pivotal GemFire, simplifying configuration, development and providing high-level abstractions.
		This document assumes the reader already has a basic familiarity with the Spring Framework and Pivotal GemFire
		concepts and APIs.
