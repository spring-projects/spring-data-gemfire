  <title>Sample Applications</title>

  <para><note>
      Sample applications are now maintained in the 

      <ulink
      url="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-gemfire-examples">Spring
      Data GemFire Examples</ulink>

       repository.
    </note></para>

  <para>The Spring Data GemFire project also includes one sample application.
  Named "Hello World", the sample demonstrates how to configure and use
  GemFire inside a Spring application. At runtime, the sample offers a
  <emphasis>shell</emphasis> to the user allowing him to run various commands
  against the grid. It provides an excellent starting point for users
  unfamiliar with the essential components or the Spring and GemFire
  concepts.</para>

  <para>The sample is bundled with the distribution and is Maven-based. One
  can easily import them into any Maven-aware IDE (such as SpringSource <ulink
  url="http://www.springsource.com/products/sts">Tool Suite</ulink>) or run
  them from the command-line.</para>

  <section id="samples:hello-world">
    <title>Hello World</title>

    <para>The Hello World sample demonstrates the core functionality of the
    Spring GemFire project. It bootstraps GemFire, configures it, executes
    arbitrary commands against it and shuts it down when the application
    exits. Multiple instances can be started at the same time as they will
    work with each other sharing data without any user intervention.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Running under Linux</title>

      <para>If you experience networking problems when starting GemFire or the
      samples, try adding the following system property
      <literal>java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</literal> to the command line
      (insert <literal>-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</literal>). For an
      alternative (global) fix especially on Ubuntu see this <ulink
      url="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SGF-28">link</ulink></para>
    </note>

    <section id="samples:hello-world:start-stop">
      <title>Starting and stopping the sample</title>

      <para>Hello World is designed as a stand-alone java application. It
      features a <classname>Main</classname> class which can be started either
      from your IDE of choice (in Eclipse/STS through <literal>Run As/Java
      Application</literal>) or from the command line through Maven using
      <literal>mvn exec:java</literal>. One can also use
      <literal>java</literal> directly on the resulting artifact if the
      classpath is properly set.</para>

      <para>To stop the sample, simply type <literal>exit</literal> at the
      command line or press <literal>Ctrl+C</literal> to stop the VM and
      shutdown the Spring container.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="samples:hello-world:run">
      <title>Using the sample</title>

      <para>Once started, the sample will create a shared data grid and allow
      the user to issue commands against it. The output will likely look as
      follows:</para>

      <programlisting>INFO: Created GemFire Cache [Spring GemFire World] v. X.Y.Z
INFO: Created new cache region [myWorld]
INFO: Member xxxxxx:50694/51611 connecting to region [myWorld]
Hello World!
Want to interact with the world ? ...
Supported commands are:

get &lt;key&gt; - retrieves an entry (by key) from the grid
put &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt; - puts a new entry into the grid
remove &lt;key&gt; - removes an entry (by key) from the grid
...</programlisting>

      <para>For example to add new items to the grid one can use:</para>

      <programlisting>-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">put 1 unu</emphasis>
INFO: Added [1=unu] to the cache
null
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">put 1 one</emphasis>
INFO: Updated [1] from [unu] to [one]
unu
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">size</emphasis>
1
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">put 2 two</emphasis>
INFO: Added [2=two] to the cache
null
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">size</emphasis>
2</programlisting>

      <para>Multiple instances can be created at the same time. Once started,
      the new VMs automatically see the existing region and its
      information:</para>

      <programlisting>INFO: Connected to Distributed System ['Spring GemFire World'=xxxx:56218/49320@yyyyy]
Hello World!
...

-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">size</emphasis>
2
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">map</emphasis>
[2=two] [1=one]
-&gt; <emphasis role="bold">query length = 3</emphasis>
[one, two]
</programlisting>

      <para>Experiment with the example, start (and stop) as many instances as
      you want, run various commands in one instance and see how the others
      react. To preserve data, at least one instance needs to be alive all
      times - if all instances are shutdown, the grid data is completely
      destroyed (in this example - to preserve data between runs, see the
      GemFire documentations).</para>

    <section id="samples:hello-world:explained">
      <title>Hello World Sample Explained</title>

      <para>Hello World uses both Spring XML and annotations for its
      configuration. The initial boostrapping configuration is
      <literal>app-context.xml</literal> which includes the cache
      configuration, defined under <literal>cache-context.xml</literal> file
      and performs classpath <ulink
      url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-classpath-scanning">scanning</ulink>
      for Spring <ulink
      url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factorybeans-annotations">components</ulink>.
      The cache configuration defines the GemFire cache, region and for
      illustrative purposes a simple cache listener that acts as a
      logger.</para>

      <para>The main <emphasis>beans</emphasis> are
      <literal>HelloWorld</literal> and <literal>CommandProcessor</literal>
      which rely on the <classname>GemfireTemplate</classname> to interact
      with the distributed fabric. Both classes use annotations to define
      their dependency and life-cycle callbacks.</para>
