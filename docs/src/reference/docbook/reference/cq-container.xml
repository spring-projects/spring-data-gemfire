  <title>GemFire Continuous Query Container</title>
  
    <para>A powerful functionality offered by GemFire is 
    <ulink url="http://community.gemstone.com/display/gemfire/Continuous+Querying">continuous querying</ulink> (or CQ).
    In short, CQ allows one to create a query and automatically be notified when new data that gets added to GemFire matches the query.
    
    Spring GemFire provides dedicated support for CQs through the <literal>org.springframework.data.gemfire.listener</literal> package and
    its <emphasis>listener container</emphasis>; very similar in functionality 
    and naming to the JMS integration in  Spring Framework; in fact, users familiar with the JMS support in Spring, should
    feel right at home. Basically Spring Data GemFire allows methods on POJOs to become end-points for CQ - simply define the query and indicate the method
    that should be notified when there is a match - Spring Data GemFire takes care of the rest. This is similar Java EE's message-driven bean style, but without any
    requirement for base class or interface implementations, based on GemFire.</para>

	<note>
	  	<para>Currently, continuous queries are supported by GemFire only in client/server topologies. Additionally the pool used is required to have the 
	  	<literal>subscription</literal> property enabled. Please refer to the documentation for more information.</para>

      <title>Continuous Query Listener Container</title>

      <para>Spring Data GemFire simplifies the creation, registration, life-cycle and dispatch of CQs by taking care of the infrastructure around them through
      <classname>ContinuousQueryListenerContainer</classname> which does all the heavy lifting on behalf of the user - 
      users familiar with EJB and JMS should find the concepts familiar as it is designed as close as possible to the
      support in Spring Framework and its message-driven POJOs (MDPs)</para> 
      
      <para><classname>ContinuousQueryListenerContainer</classname> acts as an event (or message) listener container; it is used to receive the events
      from the registered CQs and drive the POJOs that are injected into it. The listener container is responsible for all threading of message
      reception and dispatches into the listener for processing. It acts as the intermediary between an EDP (Event Driven POJO) and the event provider
      and takes care of creation and registration of CQs (to receive events), resource acquisition and release, exception conversion and the like. 
      This allows you as an application developer to write the (possibly complex) business logic associated with receiving an event (and reacting to it), 
      and delegates boilerplate GemFire infrastructure concerns to the framework.
      </para>

	  <para>The container is fully customizable - one can chose either to use the CQ thread to perform the dispatch (synchronous delivery) or a new thread
	  (from an existing pool for examples) for an asynchronous approach by defining the suitable <interfacename>java.util.concurrent.Executor</interfacename> 
	  (or Spring's <interfacename>TaskExecutor</interfacename>). Depending on the load, the number of listeners or the runtime
	  environment, one should change or tweak the executor to better serve her needs - in particular in managed environments (such as app servers), it is 
	  highly recommended to pick a a proper <interfacename>TaskExecutor</interfacename> to take advantage of its runtime.</para>

      <title>The <classname>ContinuousQueryListenerAdapter</classname> and <interfacename>ContinuousQueryListener</interfacename></title>

      <para>The <classname>ContinuousQueryListenerAdapter</classname> class is the
      final component in Spring Data GemFire CQ support: in a  nutshell, it allows you to expose almost <emphasis>any</emphasis> class
      as a EDP (there are of course some constraints) - it implements <interfacename>ContinuousQueryListener</interfacename>, a simpler listener interface
      similar to GemFire <ulink url="https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vfabric-gemfire/700-api/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/query/CqListener.html">CqListener</ulink>.</para>

	  <para>Consider the following interface definition. Notice the 
      various event handling methods and their parameters:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public interface EventDelegate {
     void handleEvent(CqEvent event);
     void handleEvent(Operation baseOp);
     void handleEvent(Object key);
     void handleEvent(Object key, Object newValue);
     void handleEvent(Throwable th);
     void handleQuery(CqQuery cq);
     void handleEvent(CqEvent event, Operation baseOp, byte[] deltaValue);
     void handleEvent(CqEvent event, Operation baseOp, Operation queryOp, Object key, Object newValue);
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting language="java">public class DefaultEventDelegate implements EventDelegate {
    <lineannotation>// implementation elided for clarity...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

      <para>In particular, note how the above implementation of the
      <interfacename>EventDelegate</interfacename> interface (the above
      <classname>DefaultEventDelegate</classname> class) has
      <emphasis>no</emphasis> GemFire dependencies at all. It truly is a POJO that
      we will make into an EDP via the following configuration (note that the class doesn't have to implement an interface,
      one is present only to better show case the decoupling between contract and implementation).</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"

	<!-- create a client-pool that uses a pool with subscription enabled -->
	&lt;gfe:client-cache pool-name="client"/&gt;
	
	&lt;gfe:pool id="client" subscription-enabled="true"&gt;
	   &lt;gfe:server host="localhost" port="40404"/&gt;
	&lt;/gfe:pool&gt;
	
	&lt;gfe:cq-listener-container&gt;
	   &lt;!-- default handle method --&gt;
	   &lt;gfe:listener ref="listener" query="SELECT * from /region"/ &gt;
	   &lt;gfe:listener ref="another-listener" query="SELECT * from /another-region" name="my-query" method="handleQuery"/&gt;
	&lt;/gfe:cq-listener-container&gt;
  
	&lt;bean id="listener" class="gemfireexample.DefaultMessageDelegate"/&gt;
	&lt;bean id="another-listener" class="gemfireexample.DefaultMessageDelegate"/&gt;
  ...
&lt;beans&gt;</programlisting>
      <note>The example above shows some of the various forms that a listener can have; at its minimum the listener reference and the actual query definition are required. It's possible however to specify
      a name for the resulting continuous query (useful for monitoring) but also the name of the method (the default is <literal>handleEvent</literal>). The specified method can have various
      argument types, the <interfacename>EventDelegate</interfacename> interface lists the allowed types.</note>
	
      <para>The example above uses the Spring Data GemFire namespace to declare the event listener container and automatically register the listeners. The full blown, <emphasis>beans</emphasis> definition
      is displayed below:</para>
      
      <programlisting language="xml"><lineannotation>&lt;!-- this is the Event Driven POJO (MDP) --&gt;</lineannotation>
<emphasis role="bold">&lt;bean id="eventListener" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.listener.adapter.ContinuousQueryListenerAdapter"&gt;</emphasis>
    &lt;constructor-arg&gt;
        &lt;bean class="gemfireexample.DefaultEventDelegate"/&gt;
    &lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

<lineannotation>&lt;!-- and this is the event listener container... --&gt;</lineannotation>
&lt;bean id="gemfireListenerContainer" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.listener.ContinuousQueryListenerContainer"&gt;
    &lt;property name="cache" ref="gemfireCache"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="queryListeners"&gt;
      <lineannotation>&lt;!-- set of listeners --&gt;</lineannotation>
      &lt;set&gt;
        &lt;bean class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.listener.ContinuousQueryDefinition" &gt;
               &lt;constructor-arg value="SELECT * from /region" /&gt;
               &lt;constructor-arg ref="eventListener" /&gt;
        &lt;/bean&gt;
      &lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Each time an event is received, the adapter automatically performs
      type translation between the GemFire event and the required method argument(s) transparently. Any exception caused by the method invocation
      is caught and handled by the container (by default, being logged).
